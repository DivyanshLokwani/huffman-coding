# huffman-coding
This project focuses on reducing the size of the Text file. Huffman Coding was developed by David A. Huffman when he was a student at MIT. It is a text compression technique and the idea behind it is giving less bits to more frequent characters and higher bits to less frequent characters. Hence, reducing the overall size of text. Using Data Structure like minheap and Hashing, we can find the lowest frequency characters and using that we can build a huffman tree. Travelling the binary tree gives the encoded data (which is smaller in size compared to the original one). At end, we retrieve our text data by decoding the encoded code.
